Manual for the programs WAVASC1 and ASCWAV1
=============================================================================

0. Introduction
---------------

WAVASC1 converts ‘basic’ type wav files to ascii files.
ASCWAV1 converts ascii files back to ‘basic’ type wav files.

A ‘basic’ type wav file is one with only two subchunks,
a 16 byte ‘fmt’ subchunk and after that a ‘data’ subchunk containing
the audio samples. Both programs work only with mono 16 bit wav files.

The ascii files contain one sample value per line.



1. File naming
--------------

1.1. These are old-fashioned programs so stick to the DOS file naming
conventions like a maximum of eight characters for file names and
directory names. The file extention should be three characters long.

1.2. If the input file or the output file is not in the same directory as
the program than the path must also be specified.



2. Input wav file
-----------------

There are two types of errors that can occur concerning the input wav file:

2.1. IO-errors. These are operating system type errors, for example if
the file you are trying to convert does not exist or can not be found.

2.2. WAV-errors. These are errors concerning the wav format. There are
three causes that will make the program reject the file you want to convert:

a. It's not a wav file.

b. It is a valid wav file but not the ‘basic type’. The program is simple
and expects a wav file with only a 16 byte ‘fmt’ chunk followed directly
by the ‘data’ chunk. If you have problems with this try saving the wav file
with a ‘simpler’ wav editor.

c. It is a ‘basic’ type wav file but it is not mono or it is not 16 bits
per sample.



3. Input dat file
-----------------
There are two types of errors that can occur concerning the input dat file:

3.1. IO-errors. These are operating system type errors, for example if
the file you are trying to convert does not exist or can not be found.

3.2. DAT-errors. These are errors concerning the dat file format. The
input ascii file must be in the form of a single column of sample values
in the range -32768...32767 (integer) separated by carriage returns.



4. Output file
--------------

4.1. These programs do not check whether or not the output file already
exists. If the given file name already exists it will be overwritten.

4.2. The file extention for both types of file can be chosen freely.



5. File sizes
-------------

5.1. The sample counters of these programs are long integers which count
from one upwards. The maximum positive value of a long integer is
2,147,483,647.

5.2. An ascii file will be larger than the corresponding wav file.
A 16 bit signed sample uses up two bytes in a wav file and the corresponding
decimal values will be in the range -32768...32767. In an ascii file every
character use up one byte so a positive sample value will consume six bytes
and a negative sample value will consume five bytes. A ‘normal’ wav file
will contain about equal numbers of positive and negative sample values.
So going from wav to ascii should increase the file size by about 5.5 bytes
per 2 bytes or something like a factor 3.
